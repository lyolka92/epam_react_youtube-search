Speaking to the BBC afterwards, Dr Wenham said it was ironic that this had happened given she recently wrote a piece for the British Medical Journal on the subject. In it she argues that the collision between our personal and professional lives that has been brought about by the Covid-19 crisis may actually help further gender equality. But she added that she never thought it would actually happen to her. It's Thursday 2 July 2020.
